# Rebellion

A Java recreation of the NetLogo Rebellion model, which in turn is an adaptation of [Joshua Epstein's model of civil violence](https://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl_3/7243).

The program is a faithful recreation of the model, however it currently lacks a GUI. Instead the model's performance is logged to console on every simulation tick.

The Statistics class can be extended to perform further, custom analysis of model performance.
